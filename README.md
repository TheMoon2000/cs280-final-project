# CS280 Final Project

In this project, we compared three transformer-based architectures on two dense prediction tasks, colorization and semantic segmentation. The architectures we considered are:
- [Dense Prediction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413)
- [Axial Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12180)
- [Uformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03106)

They were compared against a baseline UNet model on the two tasks. Checkout our report in the repo.
